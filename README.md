# Inspiration
Allyce was inspired by countless hours spent on document processing, preprocessing, keyword extraction, etc. We realized that users were tired of looking for a solution. And that's where we come in, with a simple and easy-to-understand interface that helps you understand what's in your data with just a few lines of your query.

# How we built it
Frontend: Developed with Next.js to create an interactive and user-friendly interface for visualizing flagged null values and their suggested fixes.
Backend: Built using FastAPI framework and Express to analyze codebases, integrate static analysis tools, and provide real-time feedback.
Analysis Engine: Leveraged tools like RAG, ReAct, vector databases, and a descriptive model to detect and replace potential null references.
Version Control Integration: Used GitHub.

## Built With
- flask
- langchain
