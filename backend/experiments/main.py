"""
FastAPI Application for ReAct Agent with LangChain and OpenAI
-------------------------------------------------------------

This module sets up a FastAPI application to interact with the ReAct agent. The agent is designed to process user queries,
interact with an SQL database, and return coherent, context-aware responses. The FastAPI application exposes endpoints
for health checking and generating responses from the agent.

Structure
---------
- Imports: Necessary libraries and modules.
- Data Models: Pydantic models for request validation.
- FastAPI App: Initialization of the FastAPI application.
- Endpoints: API endpoints for health check and generating responses.

Usage
-----
1. Run the FastAPI server:
    ```sh
    fastapi dev main.py
    ```
2. Access the health check endpoint at:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthcheck
3. Generate a response by sending a POST request to:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate
    with a JSON payload containing the user query.

Example:
    ```sh
    curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/generate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user_query": "Which assets Client_1 have a target allocation smaller than 40%?", "session_id": "123"}'
    ```

Dependencies
------------
- fastapi: The web framework for building APIs with Python.
- pydantic: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
